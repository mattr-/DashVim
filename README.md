# DashVim

## What is this?

DashVim is a neovim config, written in Lua.

## Why are you writing yet another config framework?

I don't think I am, really, at least not yet. I've had various config schemes for both vim and neovim over the years. This config framework is being built around a few "first principle" style ideas

 - Be extensible, so that I (or you, if you choose to use this thing) can experiment with new auto commands, keymaps, and plugins without disrupting the base set of config laid out here.
 - Be opinionated. I use this framework as my daily driver. This framework is how I want to run and configure neovim.
 - Be a learning platform. I'm motivated to do this because I'm quite tired of copying code around all the time and hoping it does what I want. If something ends up here, it's because I think it's worth graduating from my regular config sandbox.

### Are there any non goals?

A non goal is to be another distribution like LazyVim or NvChad. Both of those frameworks are great and you should use them if it works for you. I'm writing this entirely for myself because it seems like fun and I want to have fun learning and coding.

## I've seen other things in this repo before.

Yeah, this is technically the third attempt. If you're interested, there are orphaned branches for the first and second attempts. This time around, I plan to spend more time learning, so that hopefully there isn't a fourth attempt ðŸ˜„
