This is my Neovim setup powered by [ðŸ’¤ lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim) to make it easy to customize and extend your config.

You could consider it a friendly fork of [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim) as I will be taking a lot of inspiration and likely some code, from that repo. I decided to go this route after working with LazyVim and customizing it for a few months and being unhappy/not knowing how to do a few things that were important to me within the framework of LazyVim.

You shouldn't use this at all and should consider it extremely experimental. ðŸ«£
