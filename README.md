This is my Neovim setup powered by [ðŸ’¤ lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim) to make it easy to customize and extend your config.

You shouldn't use this at all and should consider it extremely experimental. ðŸ«£

This is a project I'm using for tinkering and learning. At the moment, isn't really meant to be anything serious. As I scour the internet for inspiration, code and ideas from those places will likely make their way into this project. Here are a few places I've taken inspiration from as I've been tinkering with this:
 - [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim)
 - [NvChad's UI library](https://github.com/NvChad/ui)
